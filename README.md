# Wordle-2.0

Welcome to Wordle-2.0! This is an opensource project to replicate the Wordle game and attempt to adapt the game to make it more fun! We are trying to implement this as a PWA. This is an educational experience, we are trying to learn new skills and have fun along the way. As this is open source any help would be greatly appreciated!

We are using the New York Times version for inspiration for this project. Their website can be found [here](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html?mibextid=uc01c0).

You are welcome to use this code for anything you wish. We are using this as an assignment for university so we would appreciate being credited should you use our code.
